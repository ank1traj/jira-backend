# Jira Wizard - Backend

Jira Wizard Backend is the server-side component of the Jira Wizard application. It is built with Node.js, Express.js, and TypeScript, and serves as the backend API for handling file uploads, data processing, and communication with the Jira API.

## Features

- Accepts file uploads (CSV or JSON) containing issue data
- Validates and processes the uploaded data
- Communicates with the Jira API to create issues
- Provides endpoints for handling file uploads and issue creation
- Implements error handling and response validation

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/ank1traj/jira-backend.git
2. Install the dependencies: npm install
3. Set up the environment variables: Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and configure the following variables: SECRET_KEY="SECRET_KEY"

## Server configuration
PORT=<server_port>

Replace the values in `<...>` with your own Jira API and server configuration.

## Usage

1. Start the backend server: npm start

The backend server will start running on the specified port (default: 3000).

2. Configure the frontend:

In the frontend codebase, update the configuration file with the backend server URL. This file can typically be found in the `src/config` directory of the frontend project.

```typescript
// src/config/index.ts

const config = {
  backendUrl: 'http://localhost:3000', // Replace with your backend server URL
  // Other configuration options
};

export default config;
```

Start the frontend:

Follow the instructions in the frontend README to start the frontend server and access the Jira Wizard application.

## API Endpoints
The backend provides the following API endpoints:
POST /api/user: Accepts JIRA domain, email and API token and get logged in.
POST /api/upload: Accepts file uploads (CSV or JSON) containing issue data and validates the file.
POST /api/issue: Processes the uploaded file data, communicates with the Jira API, and creates issues.
For detailed information about the request and response structures, refer to the API documentation.
